                        <p className={styles.showmore_content_text}>The procedure is performed under sedation with titrated propofol 4–8 mg/kg IV to effect. When possible, the mouth should be opened and the tongue withdrawn while the Allis, with the stent in its end, is placed into the lumen of the larynx and liberated. The prominences of the stent should be placed cranial to the vocal folds for fixation, the arytenoid cartilages should be opened with its walls, and it should be checked that the movement of the epiglottis is possible. If needed, the Allis could be used to accommodate the stent once it is placed in the glottis. The stent usually does not need any other fixation than the prominences cranial to the vocal cords if the arytenoid cartilages fail to abduce. The stent is shown in X-rays. The same technique is used in laryngeal stenosis, complication due to cordectomy; in this case, the stent is fixed by the stenosis itself. Once the stent is placed, titrated propofol IV is suspended and an oxygen face mask is again used until the dog recovers. It is necessary to check if the stent is correctly placed during this time. It might provoke a discrete cough immediately after waking, and no abnormal breathing sounds should be heard (no stridor nor noisy breathing).</p>

                        Before induction, pre-oxygenation with an oxygen facemask for several minutes at 100 mL/ kg/min. [ While in sternal recumbency ], the dog’s head was lifted, and the tongue was pulled cranially to improve visualization of the larynx. The ideally sized stent allows complete expansion inside the glottis and a good grip on the vocal cords. Currently, two sizes are commercially available: 14 and 20 mm in diameter (STENING, Spain). The surface of the prosthesis is covered with 1 mm studs to increase stability after insertion and prevent necrosis by limiting contact with the laryngeal mucosa. The stent was folded into four parts using two long Bengolea forceps: one curved and one straight. The stent was lubricated with sterile ultrasound gel and introduced into the glottis.</p>

Epiglottis movement was observed to check for any nuisance caused by the stent. A right lateral radiograph was then obtained to confirm positioning. Finally, 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone was injected intravenously after insertion to prevent laryngeal swelling. Each patient was actively monitored for 4 h after the procedure, with particular attention to the development of abnormal respiratory sounds, cough, and dyspnea. </p>

                        A small amount of water was then offered to ensure the absence of dysphagia or aspiration. The animal was discharged if no problems were encountered. The stent was repositioned if any discomfort was seen. Instructions were given to the owners after the procedure to feed small quantities of food and water under supervision for the first 24 h to avoid aspiration. The quantities of food were then increased over the next 2 d, and normal feeding habits were resumed 3 d after the procedure. A 5-d course of prednisolone at approximately 0.5–1.0 mg/kg once daily orally was started the day after the procedure. A cough suppressant (codeine at 0.2 mg/kg twice daily orally) was given if the dog developed a cough not associated with feeding.

                  <span className='bold'>Cough</span> &mdash; Mild-to-moderate cough is expected as the dog reacts to the foreign body. Coughing may be alleviated though repositioning the stent to ensure correct epiglottal movement. In all cases the cough was considered by the owner to be an acceptable side-effect of the treatment and no cough suppressant was administered.
                </p>

                  <span className='bold'>Expectoration</span> &mdash; Expectoration of secretions is expected and are mostly swallowed but in some cases can be orally discharged.

                  <span className='bold'>Bacterial infection</span> &mdash; <span className='italic'>Candida spp</span> infection has been identified in stent applications in human medicine and is assumed to contribute to the halitosis observed in some dogs. Note: severe halitosis from <span className='italic'>pseudomonas</span> infection was identified in one case in the U.S. but no tissue damage was identified on inspection and no disinfection action was taken, with no apparent ill effects.

                  <span className='bold'>Migration</span> &mdash; Migration is a possible complication of a stent implant. Migration can occur into the oral cavity or caudally into the proximal trachea, and can be corrected by repositioning the stent.
