          <p className={styles.content_text}>This white paper discusses the current state of market
          penetration for laryngeal stent products in the United States and Germany and explores
          how a strategic, multi-platform marketing and outreach campaign will accelerate
          acceptance in the veterinary community and drive revenue growth in 2023-2024.</p>

          <div className={styles.blog_post_heading}>
            <h3 className={styles.blog_post_heading_text}>Abstract</h3>
          </div>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>Stenting for the treatment of laryngeal paralysis clearly
          offers a nonsurgical, affordable alternative to the two current options
          available to animal owners &mdash; expensive, risky surgery on the one hand and progressive
          loss of quality of life until death on the other. While it stands to reason
          that the veterinary and animal support community would enthusiastically embrace
          laryngeal stenting for its life-saving potential, the reality of the situation
          is quite the opposite. Veterinarians as well as animal advocacy groups continue
          to promote the existing surgical option for laryngeal paralysis (LP) while
          denying stenting as a viable alternative. Despite successful results with no
          fatalities in the US and Germany, acceptance among veterinarians and dog owners
          remains extremely low. Eventually, stenting for LP will gain acceptance, but without
          a concerted marketing and outreach strategy and multi-platform informational campaign,
          sales revenue will remain relatively flat in 2023-2024 as forces that seek to preserve
          the status quo overwhelm forces that work for change.</p>

          <div className={styles.blog_post_heading}>
            <h3 className={styles.blog_post_heading_text}>Market penetration in the United States and Germany</h3>
          </div>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>This analysis is based on information gathered from English
          and German language LP support groups on Facebook. While these groups only
          represent a fraction of the overall population, they do reflect current
          attitudes of veterinary professionals and expert laypeople. Currently, the
          predominant view expressed by Facebook group moderators is that stent technology
          for LP is still untested and experimental. This view is not likely to change much
          in the foreseeable future. Although a small number of clinics, particularly in
          Germany, have embraced stenting, this is not reflected in the advice given on Facebook
          groups. In most posts, the stent procedure is ignored or dismissed while the
          existing surgical procedure receives unanimous approval. </p>

          <div className={styles.blog_post_heading}>
            <h3 className={styles.blog_post_heading_text}>Germany</h3>
          </div>

          <figure className={styles.figure_float_right}>
            <Image src={AntiBlogMessaging} className={styles.figure_image} alt="Anti-Stent Messaging"/>
          </figure>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>A case in point in Germany is this posting on the home page
          of the German LP support group on Facebook. It represents the official position
          of the group administrators of the group&rsquo;s the 900 active members, as
          translated below: </p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}><i>At this point we would like to make our position
          absolutely clear that with laryngeal paralysis <b>there is no alternative to
          surgery</b>.</i></p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}><i>A dog suffering from laryngeal paralysis <b>can only be
          helped by surgery</b>. An asphyxiation event can occur at any time and no one
          should have to experience that with their animal.</i></p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>This is still the group&rsquo;s official position even though a handful
          of its members have had successful stent implants and recommend it to other
          members. Attempts to advocate for the stent procedure to the group
          administrators and other group members fall for the most part on deaf ears. Stent
          advocates tire of constantly posting positive comments that are ignored or
          contradicted. The stent procedure continues to be dismissed as untested and
          irrelevant. The influence of this group and its official position is not
          limited only to the 900 active group members, but rather is passed on through
          word of mouth and social media to the larger general population. Thus, this
          anti-stent perception carries a payload which will choke off revenue growth for
          years unless countered by corrective information from other channels.</p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>The negative publicity against the stent procedure is clear
          in this 2021 interview with Germany&rsquo;s leading specialist in soft- tissue
          surgery, Dr. Carina Klesty at the Animal Clinic Duisburg. This interview is the
          only stent-related information provided to the group:</p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}><i>Dr. Klesty has implanted a couple of stents and
          discontinued this method of treatment &mdash; Her experience left her with mixed
          conclusions. In one case, the stent provided was too small and was coughed out.
          A larger stent was ordered, which became ingrown. The dog eventually had to be
          operated on by conventional means.</i></p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}><i>One dog did receive a stent which stayed in place. After
          6 or 8 weeks, the dog developed problems breathing. The larynx was so irritated
          that the stent became ingrown which led to a narrowing of the larynx. We tried
          it with smaller dogs, and that also failed. </i></p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>One could argue that Dr. Klesty, as a surgeon with 25-year
          experience performing tieback, cannot be impartial, and that she placed the
          stent with the expectation of failure without fully understanding the procedure.
          A correctly sized stent would not be coughed out, and the &lsquo;ingrown&rsquo; mass may have been normal tissue growth around the stent wall. The interview goes on
          to describe various drawbacks based on false perceptions. But this two-year-old
          interview is still is the basis for the official position of the Facebook group
          administrators. </p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>Dr. Klesty&rsquo;s interview is representative of a surgical
          community with a clear bias for the surgical status quo. Tieback surgery is a
          skill that surgeons have already mastered, and it generates significant revenue
          for their business. The status quo in Germany is maintained by a surgical
          community that is generally averse to change, lay experts who follow the
          trends set by the surgical community, and a community of primary veterinarians that
          knows little about laryngeal paralysis and often recommends euthanasia over any
          treatment at all. Although there are currently some signs of movement, all
          these factors continue to throttle revenue growth in Germany. </p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>It appears the situation worsening, not improving. On April
          12, 2023, a German veterinarian extracted a silicone stent and performed tieback
          surgery due to the patient&mdash;s extreme halitosis. Halitosis is a known issue with the silicone stent and has been ascribed in the past to bacterial infection in the area around the anterior stent aperture. So while an active veterinary
          community might have cooperated to evaluate the issue and seek a solution, the diagnosis in this case was stent rejection and necrosis. As a result, the stent implant may be
          judged a failure, the news of which will spread like wildfire and possibly be
          the death knell for the stent procedure in Germany. </p>

          <div className={styles.blog_post_heading}>
            <h3 className={styles.blog_post_heading_text}>United States</h3>
          </div>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>In the United States, the same roadblocks to market
          penetration in Germany also apply, but they are exacerbated by three factors
          that are unique to the US and Canada. These are 1) the stranglehold veterinary
          teaching institutions have on adopting new procedures, 2) the level of stress,
          overwork, and business pressures associated with veterinary practice, and 3)
          the high cost of tieback and the considerable revenue it generates.</p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>In English-language LP support groups on Facebook, the same
          anti-stent prejudice that plagues the German market also impedes revenue growth
          in the US. Negative responses to stent-related posts on some groups are often
          hostile and the pro-surgery rhetoric often borders on fanatical. Some Facebook
          groups reacted rudely to any treatment other than surgery and banned users from
          any mention of the nonsurgical medical alternative. This is because in Facebook
          groups, the most recent post always moves to the top of the post queue. Posting
          stent-related information often results in the poster being accused of
          &mdash;hijacking&mdash; the post thread. Facebook&mdash;s algorithm inherently benefits the
          majority opinion and marginalizes other viewpoints. To counter this, a Facebook
          group was created specifically for the stent procedure. However, the
          stent-specific Facebook group will continue to grow slowly unless it is
          promoted in the context of a larger, multi-platform marketing campaign. </p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>In June 2022, over 40 veterinary practices were polled on
          their willingness to perform the stent procedure. Most veterinary practices
          would not discuss any treatment options without a paid office visit. Of those
          that did respond, only one showed any openness to the procedure. All others
          referred to a tieback surgery specialist. Of the surgical specialists polled,
          none were willing to consider the stent procedure and made it clear they only
          performed the &mdash;gold standard&mdash; tieback procedure, as demonstrated in this
          response to a stent inquiry of March 22, 2023:</p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}><i>&mdash;Arytenoid lateralization (tieback) is the most
          appropriate option if surgery is needed. The stent option is relatively new,
          and we do not offer it here at this point&mdash;In my opinion, the best indication for
          the stent would be for temporary restoration of an airway in an emergency
          situation (until surgery could be performed) or in a case where we are not sure
          if the surgery makes sense to do (as a trial).&mdash;</i></p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>Of the primary veterinarians that did respond, most refused
          to read the Theron/Lahuerta-Smith study and terminated the communication. Those
          who did read the study responded that they were not comfortable performing a
          procedure on which they were not trained through an accredited veterinary
          education institution. As a private research study not affiliated with a
          veterinary school, the Theron/Lahuerta-Smith study has little or no credibility
          in the US. As observed by Dr. L., one of the only veterinarians in the US who
          has successfully performed the procedure, US veterinarians do not have the time
          or the incentive to perform a procedure that is not institutionally sanctioned
          or supported:</p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}><i>We are overworked and have little time for &quot;special
          projects&quot;, and a stent procedure coming through research channels instead
          of continuing education channels definitely qualifies as a &quot;special
          project&mdash;. Veterinarians &mdash; are exhausted and try to fix what they can fix in the
          time they have available. Since there is an &quot;industry&quot;-accepted gold
          standard procedure in the [standard tieback], most primary veterinarians feel
          like they don&rsquo;t need to build a better mousetrap, they don&rsquo;t have the expertise
          to evaluate it, there&rsquo;s a huge liability if this isn&rsquo;t as good as it seems,
          etc. </i></p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>As Dr. L. states, &mdash;continuing education&mdash; through teaching
          universities is the only way most veterinarians will update their procedures with
          new technologies. Procedures that are not taught through institutional
          education are viewed as experimental and high-risk for liability and safety.
          Without a strategy for institutional buy-in, revenue growth in the US will be
          limited to a handful of exceptionally motivated, exceptionally forward-thinking
          veterinary professionals.</p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>But possibly the biggest impediment to widespread acceptance
          is the financial structure centered around tieback surgery. In low-population
          areas of the US Midwest, surgery can cost as little as $2000, which is
          comparable to a stent implant. In Seattle and California, tieback surgery can
          cost over $8000. The national average lies at around $4200. Clearly, surgeons
          have little incentive to replace their biggest revenue generator with a non-surgical
          procedure costing under $1500. Moreover, they have little incentive to support
          a procedure that can be performed by any primary veterinarian without surgery.
          Adoption of the stent procedure would require a complete restructuring of
          revenue strategies for LP surgeons nationwide. And unlike human medicine with
          its cost-driven insurance industry, the veterinary community has no oversight
          mechanism forcing it to adopt cost-effective new procedures. Instead,
          veterinary surgeons are motivated financially to maintain the status quo, and to
          only make changes when compelled to do so by institutions or by market forces
          they can&mdash;t control. These market forces must be the basis for a
          marketing/outreach strategy that will exponentially grow product revenue in a
          short time frame.</p>

          <div className={styles.blog_post_heading}>
            <h3 className={styles.blog_post_heading_text}>Growing Product Revenue through Strategic Marketing and Outreach</h3>
          </div>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>While institutional inertia and financial interests maintain
          the surgery-centered status quo in LP treatment, there is one force in society
          for whom the status quo is simply unacceptable, and that is the <i>general public</i>.</p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>The message in Facebook groups is clear: the general public desperately
          wants an affordable, non-surgical third choice between traditional surgery and
          euthanasia. However, the information channels the general public relies on are
          controlled by players that downplay or suppress information about stent-related
          narratives. The objective of the Strategic Marketing/Outreach Initiative is to
          speak directly to the target market, i.e., the general public, and create the
          actual demand on the grass-roots level. That demand will then bubble up the
          power hierarchy to the institutional level. As the demand grows, so will its
          influence. As its influence grows, so will veterinarians increasingly recognize
          the business potential of the stent alternative. They will accede to the
          pressure from the market and will either start providing the procedure in
          greater numbers or apply increased pressure on institutions to provide that
          education. But it all begins with a campaign to speak directly to the target
          market, i.e., to the to the 400-million-strong US/German population to educate it
          in detail about the third choice that it so desperately wants. </p>

          <div className={styles.blog_post_heading}>
            <h3 className={styles.blog_post_heading_text}>Marketing Strategy</h3>
          </div>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>Unlike Facebook, whose algorithm favors the people who
          promote the mainstream perspective, non-human search engines such as Google,
          DuckDuckGo and Bing have algorithms that favor only <b><i>content</i></b> and <b><i>demand</i></b>.
          Their algorithms assign the highest search ranking to a particular type of
          content: <i>stories</i>, that is, <i>content-specific narratives</i>. Therefore,
          the most effective international marketing strategy is one that tells compelling
          stent-positive stories from all over the world. To this end, the website <a href="#" className="link-dark" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.larparlife.com</a> was created in
          January 2023. Long-term, the website will also provide detailed information on laryngeal
          paralysis, various perspectives on treatments, and helpful products for the LP community.
          It will also be a place for veterinarians to share procedure details, since
          there are clearly different approaches between US and German veterinarians
          regarding stent length and cutting the silicone material. But for the short term,
          the website needs to focus on stent procedure education and generating
          grass-roots demand. </p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>Even without a concerted media campaign, the LarParLife.com
          website is already in the top 30 results for the relevant keywords. The next
          LarParLife version will be released by April 5 in English. Working with the new
          German partner, who is also a committed and vocal stent advocate, the German
          version will follow by May 1. Once the German version launches, an
          international outreach drive will propel search ratings to the top. The site
          will be scalable, expandable, easily customizable and built to support localization
          and targeted advertising. This marketing initiative provides a solid base to
          build on for international marketing and North American sales as the LarParLife
          concept evolves into late 2023 and 2024.</p>


          <div className={styles.blog_post_heading}>
            <h3 className={styles.blog_post_heading_text}>Outreach Strategy</h3>
          </div>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>While an outreach strategy for the German market might
          require a different approach, in the United States all animal welfare projects
          and research are funded by means of non-profit organizations. Non-profit 501(c)(3)
          status is assigned by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and allows
          organization to receive donations that the donor can deduct from their tax
          liability. Tax-exempt status is an absolute requirement for any animal-related
          outreach strategy. Besides the tax-exemption for donors, 501(c)(3) status acts
          like a badge of legitimacy that opens doors that are closed to for-profit
          businesses. This will be crucial in soliciting donations from other, larger
          non-profit entities who dispense funding to worthy animal-related causes.
          Without non-profit status, any effort to establish a research partnership with
          a veterinary teaching college or university is destined to fail for lack of
          funding, and any attempt to create online or institutional procedure training
          would be prohibitively expensive.</p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>Non-profit status is also crucial for outreach to the
          hundreds of breed-specific support organizations in the US. The legitimacy of
          non-profit status is essential to ensure that animal organization members visit
          and share the website links with other members, which then drives the search
          ratings up, which then results in more website views in the general population.
          Thus, outreach and marketing are two sides of the same coin &mdash; each feeds the
          other to ensure that the stent message reaches the greatest number of people in
          the shortest amount of time. </p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>Successful media outreach does not depend on non-profit
          status. Media organizations are in the business of retelling compelling
          stories, and good-news animal stories are very sought-after. A cornerstone of
          the outreach strategy is connecting with media organizations nationwide to
          share the good-news stent narratives with the public. Another cornerstone of
          the campaign is the YouTube channel which will positive stent-related stories
          and topics from the laryngeal paralysis community. </p>


          <div className={styles.blog_post_heading}>
            <h3 className={styles.blog_post_heading_text}>Summary: Strategy for Market Breakthrough 2023/2024</h3>
          </div>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>The status quo, i.e., the market dominance of the current
          &mdash;gold standard&mdash; LP surgeries, will persist until some force displaces it. That
          force must come from the free market and must be driven by potential future
          revenue growth. That revenue growth, in turn, must be driven by market demand.
          As demand grows, so will also the market impetus to fill that demand. The only
          path to creating that demand in the general population is through marketing,
          outreach, and information. </p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>Currently, the pro-surgery players control the relevant
          information channels, as reflected in the dominance of pro-surgery voices on
          LP-specific Facebook groups. The institutional channels that represent the hard
          roadblocks to change, i.e., the veterinary teaching colleges, individual
          primary veterinarians and specialists, and industry associations, represent the
          mainstream concerns that benefit from the status quo. Breaking through this wall
          of institutional inertia will require a multi-prong marketing and outreach
          campaign that speaks to the grassroots base of animal owners and includes these
          components:</p>

          <p className={styles.content_text}>Once the campaign is initialized, it will become
          self-financing as donations from the pro-animal community help fund
          the initiative through non-profit entities. However, without initial
          capitalization and a concerted marketing/outreach/informational campaign,
          product penetration in the North American and European market will remain
          stagnant for the 2023/2024 fiscal years and beyond.</p>
