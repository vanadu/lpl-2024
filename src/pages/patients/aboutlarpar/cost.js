                      Primary veterinarians recognize symptoms, but symptoms can have many causes. A trained soft-tissue specialist will tell you exactly how far advanced the laryngeal paralysis is and if there are any coexisting conditions like masses or structural problems in the throat that can affect the treatment. This information is required for any veterinary-medical procedure, i.e. surgery or stent. Plus, misdiagnoses for Lar Par are not uncommon because there are so many conditions that can present the same symptoms. We know of one case where the dog didn&lsquo;t have Lar Par, but rather just a piece of bark lodged up her nose!

                          That&rsquo;s what we paid in 2021 at a specialist near Philadephia. It included anesthesia and the visual exam and/or laryngoscopy. Light anesthesia ensures that the dog&rsquo;s larynx is relaxed through the exam. Fees can very greatly depending on region and tend to be much higher in large metropolitan areas, particularly on the West Coast of the U.S.

                      That&rsquo;s what we paid in 2021 for three views. Some specialists may require more views depending on the report received from your primary veterinarian. If you have the radiography done by your primary veterinarian and emailed to the specialist, two views can cost anywhere from $90 to $150, with an additional $40-$90 per view. You should make it clear beforehand that the X-rays are for the specialist, otherwise your primary vet might bill you to interpret the X-rays, which isn&rsquo;t what you want. If the specialist does the radiography on-site you can expect to pay considerably more.

                      The most common surgery type for laryngeal paralysis is unilateral arytenoid lateralization (UAL, commonly refered to as &lsquo;tie-back&rsquo;) surgery. The cost of tie-back surgery varies depending on the country and region. In large metropolitan areas it can be three times what it might cost in less populated regions. Surgery for laryngeal paralysis is available in Germany for on average &euro;2000. In the U.S. Midwest, at least one surgeon offers it for about $2000, while in Seattle, San Francisco, and L.A. we&rsquo;ve heard of it costing well over $8000. In the Maryland area we received an average quote of $4400. This includes the cost of surgery, anesthesia, and the initial course of medications. However, it doesn&rsquo;t include treatment for post-op complications should they arise &mdash; and it&lsquo;s not uncommon for them to arise. You can call around to find the lowest price, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re getting the best deal. Some surgeons have more experience than others, and it&rsquo;s best to find the one with experience and a good track record rather than the cheapest one.

                    The laryngeal stent procedure costs much less than the surgical options. There are still very few providers in the U.S. so it&rsquo;s hard to get a read on pricing. We paid $1400 for Miss B&rsquo;s stent including all medications and imaging, and we were this provider&rsquo;s first commercial stent client. The cost is likely to come down once the procedure became routine. In Germany and France, where some clinics already offer stent placement as routine laryngeal paralysis treatment, the cost is approximately 1000&euro;. So the stent treatment costs on average somewhere around a quarter of the cost of surgery. This assumes that the stent doesn&rsquo;t migrate after placement and no repeat procedure is required. To learn why this might happen, see the <Link href='/patients/treatment/stent' className='link-dark'>About Laryngeal Stents</Link> page in the <Link href='/patients/treatment' className='link-dark'>Treatment Options</Link> section. Just like with suture failure in the surgical option, if the stent migrates a repeat procedure is required to replace or adjust the stent. The repeat procedure can cost as much as the original implant, less the cost of the stent itself.

                Keep in mind that as of May 2023, discussing costs for the stent procedure in the U.S. is a mostly moot point since there are so few providers. We hope that will change.

                    There is no science-based evidence that any pharmaceutical or medicinal treatment improves quality of life for laryngeal paralysis patients. Having said that, there is large body of testimonials from trusted veterinary sources, non-veterinary experts, and dog owners who report positive results for their particular dog and case. The fact is that once laryngeal paralysis reaches the bilateral stage, people will understandably do anything to help their dog. But before purchasing any pharmaceutical or naturopathic product, you should be aware that your dog will have to take it for some time before you see any effect, and you may not <span className='italic'>ever</span> see an effect, at which point you&rsquo;ll have to try something else. All pharmaceutical/naturopathic remedies are on a trial-and-error basis, and if you determine that any of them help your dog, you&rsquo;re locked in to paying for that substance indefinitely, which can become very expensive.

              <h2 className={styles.content_subhead}>Laryngeal Paralysis Cost Summary</h2>
              <p className={styles.content_text}>
                In the U.S. a definitive diagnosis for about $500 is required for surgery or stent. After that, surgery runs on average $4500, stent around $1500. Costs vary greatly by country, region and provider. Until the stent procedure is widely available, surgery in the U.S. will cost more than the stop-treatment amount for the average dog owner, which was most recently estimated at $1700. In Europe, surgery is significantly less expensive, so it stands to reason that more people will choose the surgical path. The pharmaceutical and naturopathic alternatives may alleviate some symptoms but will eventually end in end-of-life care and euthanasia. The laryngeal stent procedure will bring the cost of LarPar treatment below the $1700 stop-treatment threshold and save the lives of thousands of otherwise healthy dogs.
