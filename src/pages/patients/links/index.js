The 1-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates for dogs with postoperative aspiration pneumonia were 83.1%, 51.5%, and 25.8%, respectively.

Postoperative megaesophagus (hazard ratio [HR], 2.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56 to 3.93) and postoperative administration of opioid analgesics prior to discharge (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.80) were significant risk factors for the long-term development of aspiration pneumonia in this study.

Administration of an opioid analgesic may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia in dogs treated surgically for laryngeal paralysis.&rdquo;

Long-term follow-up information was available for all 39 dogs; mean follow-up time was 29.6 months (range, 3 to 61 months). Seven (18%) dogs developed postoperative pneumonia, and 6 of the 7 recovered with treatment. Twenty-two of the 39 (56%) dogs had minor complications, including unresolved coughing or gagging, continued exercise intolerance, vomiting, and seroma formation.

Prognosis for hereditary LP is excellent as dogs are cured by surgery. Congenital LP neuropathy has a poor prognosis and most dogs tend to be euthanased
                        within 10 weeks as a result of worsening clinical signs (Davies & Irwin 2003). The prognosis for acquired LP will vary depending on the cause: trauma cases can be cured; neoplasia-induced LP will depend on the tumour type. &rdquo;

                        <p className='showmore-content-block'>&ldquo;Evidence strongly suggests that the most common form of LP in dogs is, in fact, an early stage of GOLPP (Stanley et al.2010). Even though all complications should be considered when making a prognosis in any dog developing LP as a component of polyneuropathy, this condition progresses slowly, making short-term prognosis more favourable.&rdquo;

                        <p className='showmore-content-block'><span className='bold'>Conclusions: &ndash; </span>&lsquo;The majority of owners surveyed reported that unilateral arytenoid lateralisation had improved the quality of their dog&rsquo;s life during the first 6 postoperative months. Owner dissatisfaction with the results of surgery and the reported rate of re-presentation (for respiratory disease) may be higher for small (&gt; 10 kg) dogs. A prospective study comparing the results of unilateral arytenoid lateralisation surgery in large and small dogs may be worthwhile in the future. &rdquo;

                        <p className='showmore-content-block'><span className='bold'>Results:</span> &ldquo; Dogs that had surgical correction of ILP had a 2.6-fold reduction in the hazard of death throughout the study period (HR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.34-4.84, P = .006). Owner assessed patient quality of life (10-point scale) increased by an average of 4.1 Â± 1.4 units immediately postoperatively, and 4.9 Â± 0.9 units until death or followup compared with preoperative values. Thirty-five of 72 dogs available for followup had evidence of diffuse neurologic comorbidities. Overall complication rate for dogs with neurologic comorbidities was 74%, compared with 32% for dogs without neurologic comorbidities. Presence of any neurologic comorbidity was associated with a significantly greater odds of any complication (OR = 4.04; 95% CI: 1.25-13.90, P = .019) as well as recurring complications (OR = 8.00; 95% CI: 1.49-54.38; P = .015).&rdquo;
