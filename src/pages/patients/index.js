            Here&rsquo;s the thing about about laryngeal paralysis (Lar Par) and geriatric-onset laryngeal paralysis and polyneuropathy (GOLPP) &mdash; <span className="semibold">your dog might be perfectly healthy</span>. Liver, heart, all the vital organs are in tip-top working order. Your dog has lots of energy and wants to run, play and enjoy life. The problem is that the nerves that control two little muscles in the throat, the ones the dog uses to bark, stop working. Instead of opening and closing, the voice box (or <span className='italic'>larynx</span>) becomes paralyzed and stops letting air through.

                There is no known cure for canine laryngeal paralysis &mdash; it&lsquo;s a neurological disease that doesn&lsquo;t get better on its own.  It&rsquo;s a progressive condition, meaning it gets worse over weeks, months or years&nbsp;&mdash; it&rsquo;s not possible to predict how it will progress. In younger dogs, it can be hereditary. On older dogs, it&lsquo;s generally associated with age-related neurological decline.

                  First you&rsquo;ll want to talk to your primary veterinarian for a recommendation based on your dog&lsquo;s breathing and overall health condition. Keep in mind that primary veterinarians are generally not trained or equipped to make a Lar Par definitive diagnosis, and misdiagnoses aren&lsquo;t uncommon.

                  For a definitive diagnosis, make an appointment with a board-certified soft-tissue specialist. You can find one in your area by following the Find a Surgeon link on the <Link href='htttps://acvs.org' className='link-dark'>American College of Veterinary Surgeons</Link> website. The specialist&lsquo;s diagnosis is critical because it can tell you what stage the disease is in. You&lsquo;ll need that when you start thinking about treatment options moving forward.

            If your dog has laryngeal paralysis or GOLPP, you have some tough decisions to make. We&rsquo;ve been there and understand how hard it is to see a beloved companion struggle to breathe. The most important thing you can do is inform yourself and develop a game plan moving forward.  
          </p>
          <p className={styles.content_text}>
            What you do now depends on:

            <li className={styles.content_list_item}><FaPaw className={styles.content_list_item_svg}/>

            Those are three critical factors that will inform your decision process, so take a moment to decide which of these factors best reflect your situation:

                If money is no object, you will probably want to focus on the veterinary-medical approaches to laryngeal paralysis treatment: surgery or the laryngeal stent. Currently in 2023 there are very few stent providers worldwide, so its availablility for you depends on your location. Unless you are fortunate enough to live close to a stent provider, your only option is surgery, which has been the standard treatment for laryngeal paralysis for over 40 years. The surgery is expensive and has significant risk factors, but has a high likelihood of a positive outcome. You can read more about it on the <Link href='/patients/treatment' className='link-dark'>Treatment Options</Link> page of this website.

                You&rsquo;ll need to first weigh the cost/benefit of surgery and decide whether it&rsquo;s possible for you, either in your own budget or with help from your family or support network. If you decide you can&rsquo;t afford it, your choices are limited to the more affordable stent procedure &mdash; which unfortunately is as yet unavailable in most of the world &mdash; or to managing the condition as best as you can until end-of-life. That means means curtailing your dog&rsquo;s activities, avoiding hot weather and humidity, and other limitations. While there are prescription medications and naturopathic remedies that <span className='italic'>may help</span> some dogs, there is no scientific evidence that they <span className='italic'>will help</span> yours.

                Not wanting to subject your dog to the risks of surgery is a reasonable position that many people share. While laryngeal paralysis surgery has good success rates, any surgery &mdash; human as well as veterinary &mdash; has risks of complications that can have severe or even lethal consequences for the patient. Also, some dogs just aren&rsquo;t candidates for laryngeal paralysis surgery due to other conditions or illnesses. If surgery isn&rsquo;t an option for your dog, you may consider laryngeal stent, but until it becomes more widely available that option is limited by your location. This leaves the difficult path of trying to manage the condition with prescription medications, naturopathic remedies, lifestyle modifications, and eventually palliative care.

            This website is dedicated to helping you make informed choices about LP based on current information about stent treatments and clinical research data about surgical options. We started gathering information about the stent treatment in April of 2022 as our dog was days away from euthanasia due to end-stage laryngeal paralysis. Like many other people, we refused surgery because of the high cost and risk factors for our senior dog. As of April 2024, our dog is nearly sixteen years old and has lived over 570 days post-stent with a good quality of life, and we want everyone to have that option available to them. But if you can&rsquo;t find a stent provider, you will have to make an informed choice about other options.

Our goal is to share information we&lsquo;ve collected so that people don&lsquo;t have to repeat our work and reinvent the wheel. Unlike other sites, the stent treatment for laryngeal paralysis in dogs features prominently on these pages.
