## Google restores LarParLife.com to the top of the search rankings for authoritative content
The Internet is the biggest game of whack-a-mole in human history. It&lsquo;s a never-ending war between the armies of bad actors seeking to exploit weaknesses in new technology to rip people off against the forces of those trying to preserve the usefulness of the Internet and keep people and their data safe.

About a month ago we got an e-mail from Google informing us that due to issues with the website they are removing us temporarily from the Google search results. We checked analytics and confirmed that there had been a malicious bot attack several days earlier. LarParLife.com is a currently a simple Next.js-based static HTML website with no user data and nothing to steal, so visitors aren&lsquo;t at any risk. But the attack did uncover some security and structural issues that need to be addressed before moving forward with the next phase. These issues were resolved, and we submitted the site to Google for reevaluation in mid-April. Google&lsquo;s pure spam review includes both automated as well as human review and can take weeks or even months, and there&lsquo;s no way to know whether Google will deem a site&lsquo;s content worthy of indexing or leave it out forever. All we could do is wait and hope. 

A few days ago, LarParLife.com reappeared at the top of the search results for relevant keywords. That&lsquo;s a huge win for us because it means Google has determined that our site&lsquo;s content is not only high-quality, but is also *authoritative*. The days are over when Google could be manipulated by stuffing a dummy page with keywords or fake links. We designed our site to be an authoritative source for information about canine laryngeal paralysis in the 21st century, and we&lsquo;re thrilled to learn that Google agrees. This has cost us some time and some clicks, but we see it as a learning experience and a minor setback rather than the game-ending catastrophe it could have been. If you support our goal of bringing the laryngeal stent alternative to surgery into the mainstream of veterinary laryngeal paralysis treatment, the best way to help is to share our website. Every link helps, and we have a lot of clicks to make up.

Since Google &lsquo;disappeared&rsquo; us from the search results, there have been a lot of developments. There&lsquo;s been a rebellion in the German Lar Par community. Dr. Gregor Volleritsch at the <a href="https://tierklinik-maischeiderland.de/" className="link-dark" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tierklinik Maischaiderland</a> is nearing the 100 stent implant mark and is publicly expressing his preference for the stent implant over tieback surgery. And the number of people who have positive stories to tell about their dogs&lsquo; stent journey is growing by the day. We&lsquo;ll be working to remain the authoritative source for information about canine laryngeal paralysis in the 21st century moving forward.
